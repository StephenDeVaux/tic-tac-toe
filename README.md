### 1. How to play
Its a traditional Tic Tac Toe game where first person to have 3 in a row wins. You have 3 choices for each side to play. It can either play as a Human(ie yourself) an easy computer player or a hard computer player. 

### 2. Development
The main part of the development was to get the computer palyer working correctly. I decided to make 2 levels of difficulty. 

**Easy Computer Level** 
This was easy to implement and was a starting point for building the frame work for the entire webpage, with the idea of adding the funciton for hard computer level later on. The easy computer level just generates a random move based on the available moves with no logic to attempt to win. 

**Hard Computer Level** 
Some planning was needed for this. The basic idea is that the best move to proceed with is a solvable problem as the number of possible solutions is sufficiently small to calculate. 

The overall logic for this is shown below:

The logic for the individual function which is then used recursively is shown below:
